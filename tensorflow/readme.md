## GPU Memory Management Configuration
When using TensorFlow, managing GPU memory is crucial. By default, TensorFlow attempts to allocate all available GPU memory. This can lead to inefficient memory usage and prevent other applications from using the GPU memory.

### Why allow_growth Configuration is Necessary
Efficient Memory Usage: Allocating GPU memory only as needed allows for more efficient use of memory.
Compatibility with Other Applications: Prevents one application from monopolizing all GPU memory, allowing multiple applications to share the same GPU.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Initially allocates minimal memory and increases the allocation as the model's memory requirements grow.

### How to Configure
The configuration differs slightly between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x.

### TensorFlow 1.x

```
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto, InteractiveSession

config = ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = InteractiveSession(config=config)

```
### TensorFlow 2.x

```
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```
By using the allow_growth configuration, TensorFlow allocates GPU memory dynamically as needed. 
This results in more efficient memory usage and better resource management, reducing the risk of conflicts with other applications.
